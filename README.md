My solutions for [Advent Of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/) challenges.

- Haskell (as a noob in functional programming)

History:

- 2022: [2022-rs](https://github.com/taoky/adventofcode/tree/2022-rs)

## Challenge notes

This year's challenges are more tricky (sometimes you need to carefully check your input) compared to last year's, I think.

(TBD, or maybe not)
